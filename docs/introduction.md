## Introduction

This book is the primary reference of the Conan language, however it can also be used to learn the language.

Conan is a statically-typed language mostly influenced by C language, and in minor part by Kotlin and Rust.

### Who Conan is for

Conan isn't meant to be used in production environments. In fact, its main goal is that one can learn Conan in less than a week. Therefore, it has a limited number of keywords and functionalities.

Because of its simplicity, Conan could be a good language for students or for hobby projects.

### Conan implementations

At version 1.0 of this book, there's only a Conan interpreter in development, kconan. However Conan in the future should be a compiled language.

### Hello world

Here's the Hello World program written in Conan:

```
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```

Next chapters of the book will cover various aspects of Conan. At the end there are also some example programs you can read to have a better understanding of the language
